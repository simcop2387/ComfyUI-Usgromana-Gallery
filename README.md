2. **Image Files** (embedded in image metadata):

3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Verify the output directory path is correct
5. Try refreshing the gallery (close and reopen)

### File Explorer Not Working

**Symptoms**: Explorer view doesn't load or shows errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

3. Verify user permissions in ComfyUI-Usgromana configuration
4. Check console for NSFW API errors
5. If API is not available, filtering is disabled (expected behavior)
